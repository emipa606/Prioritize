# Prioritize many things!


This mod allows you to set priority in many things.
(Adds priority designator on architect tab)

Including
 - Blueprints
 - Designations (Mining, plant cutting, etc)
 - Plants area
 - etc..

**You can priortize each kind of job only 
(Example : Floor smoothing and constructing is different, so will not do floor smoothing(even has priority) if construction is not finished)**

# Thing priority and Cell priority

**Thing priority can prioritize things, including buildings, designated things, pawns, etc**
**Cell priority can priotitize plants area, things at that location, etc**


**What is unsafe patches in mods config?**
Unsafe patches allows more things affected by prioritizing.
Including bills ingredients, etc.

But can cause some issues.


# Controls

**Using priority designator, Use Ctrl+Mouse Wheel to increase/decrease priority.**
You can set priority between -32766(low priority)~32768(high priority).

Right click priority designator to set priority, selection options.
You can see priority even not using designator using Right Bottom priority icon settings.


# Compatibility

~~**This mod requires HugsLib**~~
Should not break existing saves.
Should conflict with anything modifies construct job. (I can fix it later)
Should compatible with various mods, and you probably can priortize them!

# Known incompatible mods at this time

~~QualityBuilder~~ (If you want to set priority in Q.B, use Cell Priority)
